title: About Us
---

_This project is situated on the lands of the Wurundjeri, Woi Wurrung and Boon
Wurrung peoples of the Kulin Nation. We pay our respects to Elders past,
present and future. This is stolen land. Sovereignty was never ceded. This
always was and always will be Aboriginal land._

Queer Aid is a community response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our purpose is
to coordinate the delivery of crucial and potentially life saving support
to people who are most impacted by the crisis. This includes people who are
immunocompromised, those who have less access to support, and people living
in precarious conditions. We recognise the inequitable distribution of care
within the colonial state, the racialised nature of police enforcement, and
the potential for this crisis to be capitalised on by colonial and fascist
interests. Queer Aid is a space to create, agitate, and demand alternatives
to the oppressive systems that led us to this crisis.

Our core organising group is made up of queer people. In using the term _queer_
in naming this group, weâ€™re approaching it not as an identity category, but as
a sticky and fluid approach to organising.  Community is an ideal we want to
work towards. We aim to share our work as freely as possible, and to prioritise
open, transparent decision making processes.
