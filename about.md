title: About Us
---

_This project is situated on the lands of the Wurundjeri, Woi Wurrung and Boon
Wurrung peoples of the Kulin Nation. We pay our respects to Elders past,
present and future. This is stolen land. Sovereignty was never ceded. This
always was and always will be Aboriginal land._

Queer Aid is a community response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our purpose is to
coordinate the delivery of crucial and potentially life saving support to
people who are most impacted by the crisis. This includes people who are
immunocompromised, those who have less access to support, and people living in
precarious conditions. We recognise the unfair distribution of care within the
colonial state, the racialised nature of police enforcement, and the potential
for this crisis to be capitalised on by colonial and fascist interests. Queer
Aid is a space to create, agitate, and demand alternatives to the oppressive
systems that led us to this crisis.

Our core organising group is made up of queer people. In using the term _queer_
in naming this group, weâ€™re not using it as an identity category, but as a way
of organising. Community is an ideal we want to work towards. We aim to share
our work as freely as possible, and to prioritise open, transparent decision
making processes.
